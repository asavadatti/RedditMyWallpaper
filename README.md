RedditMyWallpaper
=================

This is very much Work In Progress, any help regarding clean-ups, bugfixes and ideas are welcome!

## Usage

The only, non-standard Python module that is needed, is the Reddit\_API. It can be downloaded at https://github.com/mellort/reddit_api

When that is installed and working, just run main.py.
A random wallpaper will be selected and set.

## TPD and how to help

* wallpaperchanger.py needs a MASSIVE clean-up, currently it's just a working solution
* Windows and Mac support needs to be tested
* Bugs and missing features should be implemented
